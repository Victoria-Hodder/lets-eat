# Intro to Flask

In this repo you find a tour that takes you through the basic structure of a Flask app.

We have a look at the files needed to run a Flask app, URLs, templates, and jinja2.

To take the tour, clone this repo and open it with visual studio code. You need to have the extension [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) installed.


## Running the app on your system

Before you start, please create a virual environment in the project folder and activate it (example iOS):
```
# create virutal environment:

$ python3 -m venv env

# activate virutal env
$ source env/bin/activate
```
You can also follow the instructions given in the [Flask docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/?highlight=virtual)


In order to install all nececsary libraries please:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

Now run the app by using following command:
```
$ python run.py
```
